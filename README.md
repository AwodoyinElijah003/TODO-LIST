# To-Do List App

A modern and intuitive To-Do list application built with **KOTLIN** for Android. This project demonstrates best practices in UI development, state management, and data persistence using Kotlin and modern Android frameworks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Board-based Organization**: Create and manage customizable, color-coded boards (e.g., "Work," "Groceries," "Travel Plans") to categorize your tasks.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: Easily add, edit, rename, and delete tasks within each board.
- **Progress Tracking**: Each board displays a real-time progress count, showing how many tasks are completed versus the total number of tasks.
- **Persistent Data**: Your boards and tasks are automatically saved using Jetpack DataStore, ensuring that your data is preserved even after you close the app.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, sleek user interface with smooth navigation and a modern design. The app adapts to different screen sizes and includes a user-friendly floating action button for adding new items.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for the app.
- **Jetpack Navigation**: For handling in-app navigation between screens.
- **Jetpack DataStore**: For storing and retrieving user data asynchronously and robustly.
- **Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous operations and reactive data streams.
